broken relationships it is one that comes up in everyones life so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here we will talk about relationships from friends family and lovers\\nrelationships among friends we will treat first the first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating it is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common or their paths take them in divergent directions it may be difficult to find common ground in this situation it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly rather than rapidly abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings and this should be avoided if at all possible\\nthere are some instances where repair is not possible when someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requiresno demandsthe participation of both parties if the other person is unwilling to participate in the process then your efforts will be futile and will come to nothing\\n\\nonce we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party in this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place we should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities these types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked we have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others and this must be kept in mind\\nthe key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party we must try to see things from our friends perspective for many people this can be difficult as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person and yet it is essential very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable\\nkeep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem this is not always possible as human beings are not always rational but we can at least make the effort i remember in the film hoffa that there was a great line from jack nicholson he told one of his men real problems real grievances can be resolved they can be negotiated but imaginary grievances that man is going to hate you for life i have no idea if jimmy hoffa every actually said this but it sounds like something he would have said he meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends we should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man\\nwhen you have decided to make the first step it is always better to initiate contact directly do not wait for the other person to do it depending on the circumstances this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence there is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times and this is one of them the approach should be direct but neither insistent nor demanding a fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid\\nof vital importance here is that the approach be sincere one should genuinely want to contact the other party sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity there should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends this kind of thing is immediately apparent and once detected its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud if the other party is receptive to the approach we can then gradually feel our way forward taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place things may never quite go back to what they were but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference\\ntwo examples will suffice here the historian william shirer worked closely with famed correspondent edward r murrow when the two were in germany in the s yet after the war was over the two grew apart shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely he broke with murrow over these events many decades later he approached murrow all venom spent the two were able to find common ground again\\n\\nanother example makes the same point theodore roosevelt was a strongwilled insistent man to say the least he was in a position to choose his successor as president and to this end he selected a man very different from him the affable and rotund william howard taft taft eventually began to find roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life the two men eventually broke completely a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership to his credit roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up they were never the same of course but at least some cordiality was restored\\nrelationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged on the other hand it may be easier to repair such grievances or at least find common ground since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor the key here is not to expect too much although shared history and common blood may work in our favor they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships patience and persistence are most important here perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us\\n\\nrepairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult when a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here it is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken\\nstrained is one thing broken is quite another my own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done it is done one cannot really go back to what it was before amicable dealings are certainly possible and happen all the time but i would not call this friendship i would call it an uneasy equilibrium loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake\\nread more   proven ways to stop obsessive thoughts\",\n          \"louder with crowder october   \\nsamantha bee is proof positive that being funny clever or photogenic are

developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key

key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic

could be sure with whom they were actually interacting \\n\\nassorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary

key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic

could be sure with whom they were actually interacting \\n\\nassorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary

developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key

key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic

could be sure with whom they were actually interacting \\n\\nassorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only

existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others \\n\\nthe enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be \\n\\nby the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient \\n\\npki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major

        "fbi october surprise\n",
        "according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server\n",
        "cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation\n",
        "in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote\n",
        "in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added\n",
        "although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded\n",

        "according to a new report released via the new york times\n",
        "the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled\n",
        "this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years\n",
        "the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation\n",
        "the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week\n",
        "the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal\n",
        "the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe\n",
        "the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau\n",
        "in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request\n",
        "the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face\n",
